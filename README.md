# Rubik's Cube Solver in C++

A Rubik's Cube Solver implemented in C++ using multiple cube representations and search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, IDDFS and IDA*.


## Why I Built This Project ?

I wanted to understand how search algorithms work in real-world problems. The Rubik's Cube is a classic state-space search problem, making it a great way to learn about graph traversal, heuristics, optimization techniques, data structures and algorithms with their implementation.

Through this project, I explored different cube representations and compared the performance of various solving algorithms.

## Cube Representations

### 1D Array

Stores all stickers in a single array.

Advantages:
- Simple implementation
- Easy indexing

### 3D Array

Represents the cube as a 3D structure.

Advantages:
- More intuitive mapping to a real cube
- Easier visualization


### Bitboard

Stores cube information using bit manipulation.

Advantages:
- Memory efficient
- Faster state operations


## Algorithms Implemented

### DFS (Depth First Search)

Explores states deeply before backtracking.

### BFS (Breadth First Search)

Explores states level by level and guarantees the shortest solution.

### IDDFS (Iterative Deepening DFS)

Combines DFS memory efficiency with BFS optimality.

### IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*)

Uses heuristic information to reduce the search space and solves the cube more efficiently.

## Pattern Database Heuristic

To improve the performance of IDA*, I implemented a Corner Pattern Database.

The pattern database stores precomputed distances for corner configurations and provides an admissible heuristic.

Benefits:
- Faster solving
- Reduced search space
- Better scalability

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand:

- State space search
- Graph traversal algorithms
- Heuristic search
- Pattern databases
- Bit manipulation
- Memory-performance tradeoffs
- Object-oriented design in C++
